# Brotherhood Of Steel PROS Code

This Repository mainly serves for me and the rest of my VEX Team to work on the same program together, along with build it from any computer in our shop. But i have mainly opened it up to allow other teams to use our V5 Autonomous Selector if you don't know much about LVGL, PROS, or both.

Using our code is completely V5RC Legal, although you should read and understand how it works, This just serves as a template for others to use, not just copy and use.
